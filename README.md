Structural access to Markdown for LLM agents.

`md` parses Markdown into a block-level AST and exposes it through a CLI that agents can compose with standard shell tools. Every command outputs stable, machine-readable formats (JSON with `--json`, tab-separated text otherwise) so agents can read, query, and surgically edit documents without regex or string hacking.

## Why

LLM agents need to work with Markdown constantly — reading docs, editing READMEs, updating knowledge bases, managing frontmatter. But Markdown is deceptively hard to manipulate: headings nest, code fences contain false positives, frontmatter has its own grammar, and naive text operations break structure.

`md` gives agents the same structural understanding a human reader has:

- **Block-level addressing** — every paragraph, heading, list, table, and code fence gets a stable index
- **Section-aware operations** — read or replace entire sections by heading text, not line numbers
- **Span tracking** — every result includes byte and line spans back to the source
- **Safe mutations** — replacements and insertions preserve surrounding bytes exactly
- **Multi-file queries** — scan directories with `--recursive`, get file-prefixed output

## Install

```
cargo install --path .
```

Binary name is `md`.

## Quick tour

### Read structure

```sh
# Document outline with section spans
$ md outline README.md
# Introduction    1-1     block:0
## Methods        5-5     block:2
### Sub-methods   13-13   block:5
## Results        17-17   block:7

# All top-level blocks with kind and preview
$ md blocks README.md
0   Heading     1-1    # Introduction
1   Paragraph   3-3    This is the opening paragraph.
2   Heading     5-5    ## Methods
3   Paragraph   7-7    We used several methods:
4   List        9-11   - Method A - Method B - Method C

# Word counts, heading counts, link counts
$ md stats README.md
words=32
headings=5
blocks=11
links=1
sections=5
lines=24
```

### Query content

```sh
# Extract a section by heading (including subsections)
$ md section "Methods" doc.md
## Methods
We used several methods:
- Method A
- Method B
### Sub-methods
Some additional detail.

# Full-text search with block-kind filtering
$ md search "TODO" notes/ -r --kind paragraph --kind list

# Extract all links across a directory
$ md links docs/ -r

# Read frontmatter fields across a vault
$ md frontmatter vault/ -r --field title
vault/alpha.md    Alpha Doc
vault/beta.md     Beta Doc
vault/sub/delta.md    Delta Doc
vault/sub/gamma.md    Gamma Doc
```

### Extract tables

```sh
# List tables in a document
$ md table report.md
1   Feature, Status, Notes   3 rows   3 cols

# Read as TSV
$ md table report.md --index 1
Feature   Status   Notes
Bold      done     link
Italic    wip      plain text
Normal    todo

# Column projection
$ md table report.md --index 1 --select Feature,Status
Feature   Status
Bold      done
Italic    wip
Normal    todo
```

### Mutate documents

```sh
# Replace a section from stdin
echo "## Methods\n\nRevised methodology." | md replace-section "Methods" doc.md -i

# Replace a specific block
echo "New paragraph content." | md replace-block 3 doc.md -i

# Insert a block after block 2
echo "Added note." | md insert-block --after 2 doc.md -i

# Delete a block
md delete-block 4 doc.md -i

# Set frontmatter fields (dot-path, type-inferred)
md set tags doc.md '["rust", "cli"]' -i
md set author.name doc.md "Jane" -i
md set draft doc.md --delete -i
```

### JSON mode

Every command supports `--json` for structured output with full span information:

```sh
$ md --json outline doc.md
{
  "schema_version": "mdtools.v1",
  "file": "doc.md",
  "entries": [
    {
      "heading": {
        "level": 1,
        "text": "Introduction",
        "block_index": 0,
        "span": { "line_start": 1, "line_end": 1, "byte_start": 0, "byte_end": 14 }
      },
      "section_span": { "line_start": 1, "line_end": 24, "byte_start": 0, "byte_end": 272 }
    }
  ]
}
```

Mutation commands emit a structured result describing what changed, what was preserved, and the before/after spans — so agents can verify their edits without re-reading the file.

## Design principles

**Agent-first.** Every output format is designed for machine consumption. Text mode is tab-separated for easy `cut`/`awk` piping. JSON mode includes schema versions and byte-accurate spans. Error messages go to stderr with structured exit codes.

**Structure-preserving.** Mutations operate on the AST, not on text. Replacing block 3 doesn't shift block 7. Inserting after a heading doesn't corrupt a code fence. Byte spans in the output correspond exactly to the source file.

**Composable.** Each command does one thing. Agents chain them: `md blocks` to discover structure, `md block 5` to read content, `md replace-block 5` to update it. Multi-file commands accept directories and globs, outputting file-prefixed lines that downstream tools can filter.

**Fast.** Single static binary, ~2ms cold start, instant on warm. No runtime, no config files, no network. Agents can call it hundreds of times in a session without overhead.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `outline` | Heading hierarchy with section spans |
| `blocks` | List all top-level blocks with kind, span, preview |
| `block` | Read a single block by index |
| `section` | Read a section by heading selector |
| `search` | Full-text search with block-kind filtering |
| `links` | Extract all links with kind, destination, span |
| `frontmatter` | Read/project YAML or TOML frontmatter |
| `stats` | Word, heading, block, link, section, line counts |
| `table` | List, read, and project Markdown tables |
| `set` | Set or delete frontmatter fields by dot-path |
| `replace-block` | Replace a block from stdin |
| `replace-section` | Replace a section from stdin |
| `insert-block` | Insert a new block at a position |
| `delete-block` | Remove a block |

## Benchmark

`bench/` contains an agent benchmark harness that measures whether `md` actually helps LLM agents complete Markdown editing tasks compared to raw unix tools (`sed`/`awk`/`grep`).

**What exists:**
- 4 tasks spanning basic (outline extraction), intermediate (block insertion, duplicate section replacement), and advanced (block-kind-aware word replacement)
- Dual scoring — results are verified by both `md` and an independent parser (markdown-it-py) to avoid circular self-grading
- Byte cost and tool call tracking per task

**What's missing:**
- Published baseline results (no agent runs committed yet)
- Multi-file, frontmatter, table, and set tasks (Phase 2 commands untested)
- Edge case coverage (empty files, CRLF, malformed input, large documents)
- Statistical significance (N=4 tasks is a smoke test, not a benchmark)

Run the scorer validation:

```sh
pip install markdown-it-py
python bench/harness.py          # dry run: validates dual scorer
python bench/harness.py --run    # agent run: requires an agent command
```

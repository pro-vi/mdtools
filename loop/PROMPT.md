PROVENANCE (loopgen)
- archetype: goal (terminal acceptance loop)
- divergences:
  - verifier-is-a-benchmark (task): the per-criterion oracle is the bench-v2 cost
    slice (quantitative, N≥3), not a unit test. Binary at the cell level
    (hybrid Pareto-dominates unix? yes/no); statistical underneath (N≥3, no n=1 claims).
  - per-criterion work is frontier-style (from frontier archetype): diagnose →
    ONE principled fix → verify-no-regression. The "make it cheaper" work is
    open-ended, but each front HAS a fixed pass line (hybrid ≤ unix), so it stays goal-shaped.
  - cross-criterion Pareto guard (task): closing one cell must not reopen another
    (an md change touches every cell). This is the goal impact-guard, load-bearing here.
  - oracle-drift guard == "never weaken the bench" (task): the bench tasks/scorers/
    agg_util cost logic/thresholds ARE the acceptance contract; editing them is oracle drift.
- consult-capability: tier-2 (agentify GPT-Pro available; PAL/trio may be down — single programmatic consult)
- evaluator-maturity: high (dual-scored bench + agg_util intersection logic, 7 fixture tests)
- frontload gaps: (1) omlx server must be running each session (BLOCKED_EXTERNAL if down);
  (2) claude-cli runs cost real API $ — treat as a soft budget; (3) local tier is tool_calls
  basis until AC-INSTR-pi-tokens; (4) claude-cli tool_mix not captured (cost/tokens ARE).

You are running a **terminal goal loop** on this repository (mdtools).

Your job is not to explore the frontier.
Your job is to make a finite acceptance inventory — `loop/ACCEPTANCE.md`,
goal version `hybrid-attribution-v3` (clean-ablation gate) — pass **without weakening it**.

## Motive

Make `md` **earn its place** in hybrid mode on the mdtools bench-v2: hybrid never
worse than unix on correctness or cost, AND — on structural tasks — md adds
**attributable value** beyond a unix-capable agent given the *same* prompt
(hybrid must beat a `hybrid-no-md` baseline). By improving `md` and its hybrid
prompting — **never** by weakening the bench, and **never** by neutering md via
the prompt. A bare "hybrid ≥ unix" goal is gameable: hybrid *contains* unix, so
steering the agent away from md wins it while md never improves — which is why
structural cells gate on md-lift, not just ≥unix.

## Runner contract

Runner-agnostic; you are one iteration. Durable state lives in `loop/` files,
not memory. Emit `stop-and-summarize` when no useful iteration remains; emit
`escalate: <reason>` only for genuinely irreversible/external blocks (paid-API
with no budget cap, secrets, public publish). External ceilings (tokens, time)
are runner concerns — preserve the tree and summarize for the next run.

**You run UNATTENDED — no human is watching this iteration.** Therefore you must
**NEVER call `AskUserQuestion` (or any interactive / blocking / approval-prompt
tool), for ANY reason** — not cost, not "which cell?", not an ambiguous oracle,
not a risky edit. An interactive prompt to an absent human is a guaranteed
overnight deadlock. Every decision routes one of two ways instead: **(1)
reversible** → take the smallest reversible default consistent with the strongest
source, log an Alignment Review, and continue; **(2) genuinely needs a human /
irreversible** → do NOT prompt — finish any free work, then `stop-and-summarize`
with the right halt label (`derivation-gap` for a missing spec/decision,
`genuine-escalate` for an irreversible/budget block, `partial-deadlock` for a
non-$ block) and put the question + options in the summary. **The halt-summary is
the ONLY channel to the human — async, never interactive.** (This is *why* the
loop blocked tonight: it hit a cost decision and reached for `AskUserQuestion`;
the Budget policy fixes the cost path, and this rule closes the tool globally.)

## Judgment default

On a taste/inferred call: take the smallest reversible action consistent with
the strongest source, log an Alignment Review (problem · options · chosen ·
alignment cost · rollback trigger · review question), and continue. Escalate
only for irreversible/external/authority-needed actions. Frontier (claude-cli)
spend is governed by the **Budget policy** below (token-denominated cap in
`frontier_token_cap`, write-ahead ledger, per-task atoms, defer-don't-block) —
never `AskUserQuestion` on cost; defer over-cap frontier work and keep making
free local progress per that section.

## Budget policy (unattended-safe)

This loop runs **unattended overnight**. Cardinal rule: it must NEVER fire an
interactive question (`AskUserQuestion`) and NEVER idle waiting for a human.
Money is the only resource that can force a stop, so spend is governed by an
**autonomous cap the loop may consume without asking**; frontier work beyond it
is **deferred (logged + resumable)**, not blocked. Free local work always
continues. This *refines* (never relaxes) the Judgment-default and the halt
classifier — it replaces the old "paid-API without budget cap → AskUserQuestion"
escalation with a logged, resumable handoff.

### Tokens are the unit (USD is uncomputable here)

The harness (`bench/harness.py:1189-1195`) records ONLY `tokens_in` (input +
cache-create + cache-read) and `tokens_out` from `result.usage`. There is **no
token→USD price table anywhere in `bench/` or `loop/`** — so a USD cap is a
number the loop cannot observe. **The cap is therefore TOKEN-denominated.** All
gating, all cumulative accounting, all recalibration use **frontier tokens**
(`tokens_in + tokens_out`, summed from real run records), never dollars.

- USD figures (the `$50` seed family, `$1.40/cell`) are **operator-facing
  context only** — NEVER an operative gate input. If a human wants a $ readout,
  pin an explicit price table in this PROMPT (`in_$/Mtok`, `out_$/Mtok`,
  cache-read rate) and the loop MAY *render* `usd = (in·in_$ + out·out_$)/1e6`
  for the handoff summary — derived, advisory, post-hoc, never the gate.

### Two cost bases (never traded against each other)

- **LOCAL tier** (`pi-json` / `oai-loop` via omlx) — **free**, tool_calls basis.
  **No spend gate. Never deferred, never counted against the cap.** Local-tier
  unavailability (omlx down) is `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL`, not a budget event. **Local
  cell-CLOSING work** (`md`/src edits + `HYBRID_DOCS` tuning re-validated on the
  local verifier and the cheap inner channel `cargo test` + `bench.test_agg_util`)
  is **ALWAYS-AVAILABLE free progress**, distinct from one-time local inventory
  instantiation — while ANY local move exists the loop keeps iterating.
- **FRONTIER tier** (`claude-cli`) — real $, **token basis** — governed by the
  cap below. Its tokens are never compared to local tool_calls.

### The cap lives in PROMPT.md, not STATE.md (no lost-update race)

The loop **rewrites STATE.md every iteration**, so a human-edited field there can
be clobbered by the loop's end-of-iteration full-file write (re-read-at-start +
full-rewrite-at-end = lost update). Therefore:

- **`frontier_token_cap`** (the human-authored authorization) lives **in THIS
  file (PROMPT.md), which the loop only READS** — set it on the line below.
  A supervisor edits it here; the loop adopts it next iteration (re-entrant).
  `frontier_token_cap: 0`  ← **EXPLICIT operator choice (2026-05-30): local-only night — ALL frontier deferred for supervised morning review. This is a deliberate "local-only night", NOT an unset default; do NOT treat as `derivation-gap`. Raise it in THIS file to authorize unattended frontier spend.**
- STATE.md holds ONLY the loop's OWN bookkeeping:
  `frontier_tokens_cumulative`, `per_task_tok_est`, `frontier_ledger`,
  `deferred-frontier`, `probed_cells`. The loop never writes the cap.

**No safe universal default.** `frontier_token_cap` is a **required kickoff
input**, not a silent `0`. If genuinely unset/absent, treat iteration 0 as
`derivation-gap` ("cap not provided") in the halt summary — do NOT silently pick
`0` and burn the overnight window on a guaranteed no-op. `0` is a deliberate
**"local-only night"** the operator chooses explicitly (full local progress, ALL
frontier deferred, clean handoff) — never the fallback.

**Restart / lifetime semantics.** `frontier_tokens_cumulative` is reset ONLY by
the supervisor (zero it explicitly to open a fresh budget window). The loop NEVER
resets it itself. A cap RAISE = new ceiling for the SAME cumulative — last
night's spend still counts until the supervisor zeroes the cumulative. This
prevents both permanent-lockout and silent restart double-spend.

### Conservative token estimate (gate on worst-case, recalibrate down only)

Estimate a frontier batch's tokens **before** running it:

```
est_batch_tok = n_tasks × n_modes × N × per_task_tok_est
```

- `n_modes` = **count the `--mode` invocations in THIS batch's ready-cmd** (the
  gate runs `unix, hybrid, hybrid-no-md` ⇒ 3) — NEVER a hard-coded constant; if
  the gate definition ever changes, the formula tracks the actual launch.
  `mdtools` mode is diagnosis-only, never in a frontier batch.
- `N` = replicate count (gate = **3**; a diagnosis probe is also **N=3** —
  Anti-theater forbids n=1 claims, so the smallest *valid* probe is `1×1×3`).
- `per_task_tok_est` = **conservative UPPER bound, not a blended mean.** Seed:
  **`153000` tok** per (task×mode×replicate) — the documented *max* of T7's
  82k–153k spread, applied to ALL of T7/T10/T13/T20 (only T7 is measured, n=1;
  T10/T13/T20 are unmeasured ⇒ priced at T7's max until each earns its own n≥3
  actual). **Recalibration may only LOWER `per_task_tok_est`** when sustained
  n≥3 actuals justify it; it may NEVER silently raise headroom. All current
  numbers are n=1 (per STATE.md `known_baseline`) — not a basis for a tight cap.
- **Headroom factor.** A single `harness.py --run -N3` invocation commits a whole
  tasks×modes×N batch in ONE process and the loop does NOT hard-kill mid-flight
  (that wastes paid spend). So per-batch overrun is bounded structurally, not by
  abort: **issue frontier work ONE TASK (one `--task`) at a time** so the cap is
  re-checked between the smallest atomic harness invocations, and only launch an
  atom if `remaining_cap ≥ per_task_tok_est × n_modes × N × 1.5` (the 1.5×
  absorbs the documented ~1.9× single-task variance). `remaining_cap =
  frontier_token_cap − frontier_tokens_cumulative`, per-run cumulative.

### Write-ahead spend ledger (a crash fails CLOSED, never re-spends)

The spend record lives in loop-rewritten STATE.md, so an unattended mid-iteration
crash must not lose it. WAL discipline:

1. **Before** launching any frontier atom: write a `frontier_ledger` entry
   `{ atom, status: launched, debit_tok: per_task_tok_est×n_modes×N }` and
   **pre-debit** that worst-case to `frontier_tokens_cumulative`, then flush
   STATE.md.
2. Run the atom. **After** it returns: **reconcile** `frontier_tokens_cumulative`
   to the atom's REAL `tokens_in+tokens_out` summed from the run record (replace
   the pre-debit with measured), set the ledger entry `status: reconciled`,
   recalibrate `per_task_tok_est` (lower-only) from the actual, flush STATE.md.
3. **On iteration start:** any `frontier_ledger` entry left `launched` (no
   `reconciled`) means a prior atom spent but didn't record — **assume the
   worst-case debit stuck and do NOT re-run it** (resume only un-launched atoms).
   The cumulative is summed from **run-record tokens, never from the estimate.**
4. **Errored / timed-out atoms still spent** (claude was billed for tokens
   generated before timeout): debit their worst-case estimate and **never
   re-launch a partially-completed batch** — per-task atoms make "resume only the
   unrun tasks" natural. A timed-out cell is a paid cell.
5. **Bootstrap STATE.md** with all five loop-owned fields at iteration 0 so the
   gate is live from the very first frontier reach.

### Per-iteration spend protocol (never block, never idle)

1. **Always do the free local work first** — any LOCAL-tier verifier, diagnosis,
   `md`/`HYBRID_DOCS` cell-closing edit, inner channel — independent of cap state.
2. For the chosen frontier atom compute `est_batch_tok` (formula above).
3. **Run iff `per_task_tok_est > 0 AND est_batch_tok ≤ remaining_cap AND
   remaining_cap > 0 AND remaining_cap ≥ est_batch_tok × 1.5`.** Then WAL-write,
   run, reconcile (above), and continue. (A zero estimate is a bug, not a free
   pass — assert `per_task_tok_est > 0` always.)
4. **If it does not fit (or `frontier_token_cap == 0`):** do NOT ask, do NOT
   shrink the gate to fit (running N<3 or dropping a mode to squeeze under the
   cap is **oracle-drift** — forbidden). Instead:
   - **DEFER the batch** into STATE.md `deferred-frontier:` keyed on a
     **COMPOSITE `(cell, batch-kind)`** where `batch-kind ∈ {instantiation, gate,
     probe}` — so an instantiation deferral and a gate deferral for the SAME cell
     **coexist** (cell-only keying silently loses one). Idempotency updates the
     matching `(cell, batch-kind)` entry only; never duplicates. Each entry
     carries `{ cell, batch-kind, tasks, modes, N, est_tok, est_usd?(advisory),
     reason, ready-cmd(verbatim) }`.
   - **Probe sub-budget (strict).** A probe is the smallest *valid* frontier
     reach (`1 task × 1 mode × N=3 ≈ 459k tok`, NOT the often-misquoted `1×1×1`).
     A probe is worth firing ONLY IF **`frontier_token_cap > 0`** AND it fits
     `remaining_cap × 1.5` AND **after the probe `remaining_cap` could still fund
     at least one FULL gate batch for some cell** (else the probe is pure burn —
     diagnosis-only work can never advance a cell per Anti-theater, so spending
     the last money on a probe that closes nothing is forbidden — defer instead).
     **At most ONE probe per cell per run** (record in STATE.md `probed_cells:`;
     an already-probed cell is never re-probed unless a `md`/`HYBRID_DOCS` edit
     invalidated its diagnosis), capped at **≤10% of `frontier_token_cap`** total.
     Probe spend counts in `frontier_tokens_cumulative` like any frontier spend.
   - **Continue the iteration** on remaining free local / no-cost work. The loop
     never stops on a single deferred batch.
5. **Global-md staleness.** Any `md`/`HYBRID_DOCS`/`MDTOOLS_DOCS` edit touches
   every cell (dependency topology), so it marks **ALL `deferred-frontier`
   `est_tok` STALE** — re-estimate them from the current `per_task_tok_est` next
   iteration. The verbatim `ready-cmd` stays valid; only the budget figure refreshes.

### Bootstrap clause (iteration-0, the live deadlock fix)

The frontier `AC-frontier-*` and `AC-MASTER` rows are CREATED by a paid
full-suite frontier sweep (Bootstrap step 5 `init-frontier`): **24 tasks × 3
modes × N3 ≈ 33M tok** at the seed estimate — roughly **6× the seed-family
batch**, and the FIRST frontier dollars spent, before any per-cell gate. So:

- **Instantiate the LOCAL inventory FULLY** (free, always) — write every
  `AC-local-*` row from the local sweep.
- Treat the **frontier inventory-instantiation sweep as the FIRST
  `deferred-frontier` entry** with `batch-kind: instantiation` and its verbatim
  `init-frontier` ready-cmd + `est_tok ≈ 33M`. Immediately write the
  `AC-frontier-*` and `AC-MASTER` rows as **placeholder status
  `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL(no-budget)` / DEFERRED** so the inventory gate, halt
  classifier, and final-verify all SEE them (the deferral machinery now has a
  `cell` to key on — no "defer the act of creating a cell" gap).
- A **partial bootstrap (local instantiated, frontier deferred) is the CORRECT
  iteration-0 outcome at any cap below ~33M** — NOT an escalation, NOT a failure.
  It still ENDs iteration 0 having made full local progress.
- **Cap-sizing truth for the supervisor** (surface in the handoff): a cap sized
  for the seed family alone (~5.5M tok) funds NOTHING — it can't pay
  instantiation, so no `AC-frontier-*` row exists for the seed gate to attach to.
  **`frontier_token_cap` must cover instantiation (~33M) + at least one gate
  batch (~5.5M) to make ANY frontier progress.** State `full_frontier_cost_tok`
  (instantiation + every gate, ~the whole suite) in STATE.md so the supervisor
  knows the cap for **terminal completion**, not just the next batch.

### Final-verify is all-or-nothing across tiers (terminal needs full cap)

Terminal `criteria-met` needs the full-suite 4-mode × **both tiers** final-verify
in one repo state — always a frontier run requiring EVERY cell. A cap below
`full_frontier_cost_tok` means final-verify **cannot run**; the run reaches at
most `PASS_PENDING_FINAL` on funded cells. **A partial frontier cap yields a
checkpoint, not terminal credit** — say so in the handoff so an operator who
funds a partial cap expects a checkpoint, not partial completion.

### Clean halt — only when ONLY paid work remains AND no in-cap reach exists

The loop halts (never idles, never asks) ONLY when **every** remaining unpassed
cell needs frontier tokens AND **no local move of any kind remains** (no local
cell to close, no `md`/`HYBRID_DOCS` edit that the local verifier could advance)
AND `remaining_cap < the cheapest fitting frontier reach` (can't afford even an
admissible probe: halt iff `remaining_cap < min_probe_tok` — a probe is still
allowed at exactly equal). AC-MASTER/`AC-frontier-*` being deferred is NOT by
itself a halt trigger while any local move exists. Then emit `stop-and-summarize`:

- **`genuine-escalate`** — cap **EXHAUSTED after real frontier spend** (matches
  PROMPT.md "claude budget exhausted"). Summary MUST carry the full
  `deferred-frontier` list (per-batch `est_tok`, optional advisory `$`),
  `frontier_tokens_cumulative`, `frontier_token_cap`, `full_frontier_cost_tok`,
  and verbatim `ready-cmd`s — supervisor approves/raises the cap with zero
  re-derivation. This replaces the old interactive question.
- **`derivation-gap`** — cap **UNAUTHORIZED / missing-from-the-start with ~0
  spent** (the `frontier_token_cap` unset / `0`-by-default case). This is a
  missing *authorization*, not an *exhausted* resource — do NOT mislabel it
  `genuine-escalate`. Name the missing cap grant so the next pass supplies it.
- **`partial-deadlock`** — remaining cells blocked for non-$ reasons (omlx down,
  STUCK tie-targets) rather than cap exhaustion.

Reaching the cap is **expected and clean**: full local progress plus a logged,
costed, resumable frontier backlog is the unattended-safe outcome. The loop only
ever stops with a fully-prepared approval handoff — never mid-question, never idle.

## Oracle principles (honest by construction)

1. **Binary** — each cell criterion is pass/fail via `attribution_verdict`
   (verdict == `CLOSES`?), never self-assessment.
2. **Independence** — the oracle (bench-v2 slice) already FAILS the unmet
   behavior (claude T7 hybrid loses on cost). A verifier that can't fail can't
   prove. If you add/extend a verifier, show it red on the current gap first.
3. **Consumer-side** — "if this cell passes, would a user genuinely be better
   off using `md` here than plain unix?" If it requires inference, the verifier
   is wrong.
4. **Anti-theater** — `FIXED ≠ CLOSED`. A cell's own run passing is
   `PASS_PENDING_FINAL`. `PASS` requires the **final-verify** to prove the whole
   inventory in one repo state at N≥3. **No n=1 claims, ever.** A 1-task or
   single-replicate **probe is diagnosis only** — it can never set or advance a
   cell's status; status changes require the full category × 3-gate-mode ×
   tier-runner × N≥3 verifier.

## Terminal contract

Complete only when **every** criterion in `loop/ACCEPTANCE.md` reaches `PASS`
via the final-verify. Then emit `criteria-met` → `stop-and-summarize`, halt
cause `criteria-met`. Not for partial completion, not for "the easy cells", not
for a single green run.

## Acceptance + verifier discipline

`loop/ACCEPTANCE.md` is the live anchor. The verifier for a cell = run that
(tier × category)'s tasks × **{unix, hybrid, hybrid-no-md}** × the tier's runner
at **N≥3**, then `python3 bench/report.py <outputs>` and read the cell's
**md-attribution verdict**. The source of truth is
`agg_util.attribution_verdict`'s **return value** — `report.py` only *renders*
it; never treat report.py's printed text as authoritative if you've touched the
renderer. **Valid pass evidence:** verdict == `CLOSES` at N≥3
(structural ⇒ hybrid beat unix AND beat hybrid-no-md AND the baseline didn't
flail; tie-acceptable ⇒ hybrid ≥ unix). **Invalid:** "looks better", n=1, a cost
win from hybrid *failing* an expensive task, a relaxed scorer, a narrowed task
set, or a `CLOSES` faked by neutering the prompt (impossible — that yields
`OPEN:no-lift`).

## Channels

- **Cheap inner channel** (after any edit, before the bench): if `md` changed,
  `cargo build --release && cargo test` (337 Rust tests) ; always
  `python3 -m bench.test_agg_util` (the oracle's own tests must stay green).
- **Per-criterion verifier:** the cell's bench run over **4 modes** (unix,
  hybrid, hybrid-no-md, + tier runner) → the attribution verdict, N≥3.
- **Final-verify:** full suite × **4 modes** × both tiers at N≥3 →
  `python3 bench/report.py loop/runs/final/*.txt` → assert EVERY cell verdict ==
  `CLOSES`. Run for terminal completion and as a checkpoint after any `md`
  change (which touches every cell).

## Dependency topology

`AC-MASTER` depends on every `AC-{tier}-{cat}`. The cells are otherwise
independent **except**: any `md` change or `HYBRID_DOCS`/`MDTOOLS_DOCS` change
affects **every** cell — so after such an edit, the impact guard = re-run the
**already-passing** cells of that tier and confirm none regressed (the
**Pareto-no-regression guard**, load-bearing). `AC-INSTR-*` are enablers, not
fronts; do them only if they sharpen measurement.

## Iteration protocol

1. Read `loop/ACCEPTANCE.md`, `loop/STATE.md`, the latest `loop/runs/` outputs.
   Confirm the `goal_version:` field matches. **Check omlx is up** (`curl -s -m4
   -H "Authorization: Bearer 215069" http://127.0.0.1:10240/v1/models`); if down
   → `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL`. **Inventory gate (where am I?):** if the AC inventory is
   not yet instantiated — STATE.md `iteration: 0`, or no `loop/runs/init-*` slice
   exists — run the **Bootstrap** (§ below) to instantiate it, write the
   `AC-{tier}-{cat}` rows + bump `iteration` in STATE.md, and END this iteration
   there (do not also pick a cell). Otherwise skip the Bootstrap entirely and
   continue to step 2 — the Bootstrap is iteration-0-only and must NOT re-run.
2. **Oracle integrity check** before editing: bench tasks/scorers unchanged,
   `agg_util` cost logic + thresholds unchanged, no task removed from a cell, no
   tolerance loosened. Any such change = `oracle-drift` (see guard).
3. If every cell is `PASS_PENDING_FINAL`/`PASS`, run the **final-verify**. If it
   proves the whole inventory in one repo state at N≥3: set all `PASS`, write
   `loop/VERIFY.md` with the slice, emit `criteria-met` → `stop-and-summarize`.
4. Else pick **one** primary failing/`OPEN` cell — strongest failing evidence
   first (seed: `AC-frontier-Targeted-mutation`), cheapest verifier feedback,
   highest regression risk. If every unpassed cell is `STUCK`/`BLOCKED`/
   `QUARANTINED` → halt classification.
5. Before editing write one line:
   `cell-id | failing-evidence | hypothesis-for-WHY | edit-surface (md or HYBRID_DOCS) | rollback`.
   **Diagnose the WHY first** — run the failing cell with `--log-dir
   loop/runs/diag/` and read the agent trace + per-call token/tool-call
   breakdown. (e.g. did `md tasks --json` emit a huge payload? did the agent
   re-query? did it pick `md` where `grep` was one line?)
6. Make **one** small reversible change to `md` (src/) or the hybrid prompting
   (bench/harness.py `HYBRID_DOCS`/`MDTOOLS_DOCS`) targeting that root cause.
   Run the cheap inner channel; fix or revert if it fails.
7. Run the cell's verifier — **all 4 modes** (unix, hybrid, hybrid-no-md, tier
   runner) at N≥3 → the attribution verdict. Then run the impact guard for
   already-passing cells of the affected tier.
8. Accept only if: the cell moves toward pass (or gains sharper evidence), **no
   passing cell regresses** (Pareto guard), and the oracle was not weakened.
   Else revert and record the failed hypothesis.
9. Cell verifier passing → `PASS_PENDING_FINAL`, not `PASS`.
10. 3 consecutive failures with no new evidence → `STUCK`; if the cell is one
    where unix is structurally better and no admissible md/prompt change closes
    it, document it as a **tie-target** (hybrid ≥ unix is the win) and move on.

## Oracle-drift guard == "never weaken the bench"

The headline failure mode. The loop must NOT: remove/relax a bench task or
scorer; change `agg_util`'s intersection/cost/attribution logic to flatter `md`;
loosen the 5% tolerance; drop tasks from a cell to shrink the comparison; count a
cost "win" that came from hybrid **failing** an expensive task; **game the
attribution baseline** — push md in `HYBRID_DOCS` so `hybrid-no-md` FAILS tasks
or repeatedly hits the md stub (the verdict catches this as
`SUSPECT:baseline-flails(correctness|probes|cost)`; the baseline must stay a
clean unix fallback, so the win must come from hybrid being BETTER, not the
baseline being worse); refresh an expected fixture to current wrong output;
**edit `report.py`'s rendering to alter the printed verdict**; **hand-write,
edit, copy, or synthesize any run-record JSON** under `loop/runs/**` (every
record `report.py` consumes must be the verbatim stdout of a harness run you
executed *this* session — "report.py printed CLOSES over files I own" is not a
real pass); or claim a front at n=1. Any change to the **measurement** (not the
thing measured) requires an inline Oracle Change Note in `loop/STATE.md`, and is
admissible ONLY if it passes a mechanical strictness check the agent cannot fake:
**(a)** every existing `bench/test_agg_util.py` test still passes **unmodified**
(editing that file to accommodate the change is itself `oracle-drift`); **(b)**
you add a sentinel that is RED both before and after on the current gap; **(c)**
the previously-recorded failing evidence still yields a non-`CLOSES` verdict
under the new code. If you can't prove all three, restore the old verifier or
emit `oracle-drift` and stop.

## Rules / scope

- **Allowed to change (the ONLY two lever surfaces):** `src/**` (the `md` tool)
  and, inside `bench/harness.py`, **only the `MDTOOLS_DOCS` and `HYBRID_DOCS`
  string literals** (the hybrid prompting) — plus `md`'s own `--help`/docs.
  Nothing else in `harness.py`. Inner-channel check: `git diff bench/harness.py`
  must show changes confined to those two literals; a diff anywhere else =
  `oracle-drift`, revert.
- **The immutable oracle (canonical list — Forbidden to change):**
  `bench/tasks/**`; **all of `bench/harness.py` except the two doc literals**
  (the scorers `StructuralDiffPolicy` / `score_task` / `score_json_canonical` /
  `score_structural_json` / the independent scorer all live here — they are
  oracle, not lever); `bench/agg_util.py` (intersection/cost/**attribution**
  logic + thresholds); `bench/report.py` (it only *renders* the verdict —
  editing it to change what verdict prints is drift); `bench/command_policy.py`
  (the mode guard + soft-stub + policy-sync check); `loop/ACCEPTANCE.md`
  criteria/thresholds; and **every run-record under `loop/runs/**`** (evidence,
  never a lever — see oracle-drift guard).
- `md` stays **general-purpose markdown tooling** (CLAUDE.md: "markdown
  primitives only"). No task-specific hacks. Honor "hybrid > pure / don't
  replace sed" and "re-query is the moat".
- **No overfitting:** a fix must close the cell's *category* generally, not just
  one task — validate the whole category at N≥3, and run the impact guard.
- Partial completion is not success: continue while any unpassed cell has a
  legal reversible next move in scope.

## Halt conditions / classifier

Halt = `stop-and-summarize` (+`criteria-met` first on terminal success). Label:
- `criteria-met` — final-verify proved every cell at N≥3.
- `partial-deadlock` — remaining cells all `STUCK`/`BLOCKED_EXTERNAL`/
  `QUARANTINED` (e.g. unix-structurally-better tie-targets that already ≥ unix;
  or omlx unavailable). Preserve evidence, list each unpassed cell + latest
  failing evidence + the next required lever. **Do not lower the bar.**
- `oracle-drift` — the bench/criteria can't be preserved without weakening.
- `derivation-gap` — blocked on something this prompt should have specified;
  name it so the next `/loopgen` pass adds it.
- `genuine-escalate` — irreversible/external (claude budget exhausted, omlx
  needs manual start, etc.).
- `wrong-loop` — if a cell genuinely needs open-ended metric-pushing with no
  fixed pass line, reroute that piece via `/loopgen` to the `frontier` archetype.

## Artifacts to maintain

- `loop/ACCEPTANCE.md` — frozen criteria; mutable `status`/`last_verification` only.
- `loop/STATE.md` — goal version, iteration, current cell, stuck counters, Oracle
  Change Notes (inline), last/next action.
- `loop/VERIFY.md` — final-verify slice transcript; written on `criteria-met`.
- `loop/runs/**` — per-cell bench outputs (keep; they are the evidence).
- **Skill Harvest** (`loop/runs/harvest-*.md`): when an iteration exposes a
  reusable lesson (a missing invariant, an md-design pattern that generalizes,
  a bench gap), capture target-skill · observed-gap · evidence-iteration ·
  proposed-rule · why-it-generalizes · accidental-encouragement-risk.

## Repo-specific overlay

- **Build first if `md` changed:** `cargo build --release` (binary
  `target/release/md`). The bench uses `--md-binary target/release/md`.
- **Run a cell (the 3 gate modes):** for `MODE in unix hybrid hybrid-no-md`:
  `python3 bench/harness.py --run --runner <R> --mode $MODE --task <Tn> --md-binary target/release/md -N 3 --json --log-dir loop/runs/<tag>/ > loop/runs/<tag>/<Tn>_$MODE.txt`
  (output is text-summary-then-JSON-array; `report.py` parses it). `mdtools` mode
  is optional, for diagnosis only — the attribution gate uses unix/hybrid/hybrid-no-md.
- **Tiers:** FRONTIER `--runner claude-cli` (default claude; real token cost;
  claude's Bash bypasses the guard so `tool_mix`/`mutations` are blank — cost is
  fine). LOCAL `--runner pi-json --model Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-8bit` (pi on local Qwen
  via omlx; `tool_mix`/`mutations` capture; tokens currently 0 → tool_calls
  basis until `AC-INSTR-pi-tokens`).
- **Slice + verdicts:** `python3 bench/report.py loop/runs/<tag>/*.txt` → read
  `=== COST SLICE (bench-v2) ===` (per-cell cost basis `tokens` vs `tool_calls`,
  never compared across bases) AND the `md-attribution verdicts` section (each
  cell's `CLOSES` / `OPEN:*` / `SUSPECT` — the loop's work list).
- **Seed cell `AC-frontier-Targeted-mutation` (the gated delta):** once the
  inventory is instantiated, start closing here. The delta to target is the
  **gated** one: on T7, **hybrid** costs ~+6500 tok over unix (82367) — just over
  the 5% tolerance (~4118) — so the cell reads `OPEN:loses-unix`. (The
  often-quoted +70427 is **mdtools** mode, which is diagnosis-only and NOT in the
  gate — don't chase it; tuning mdtools output won't move the verdict.) Diagnose
  why hybrid's `md` usage adds ~6.5k tokens (md `--json` payload size, or an extra
  re-query) from the `--log-dir` per-call breakdown, then make it leaner.
- **Consult (tier-2):** for a genuinely stuck diagnosis (why is md a trap on a
  cell?), you may fire one `/agentify` GPT-Pro consult; log it.

## Bootstrap (iteration-0 only — gated by the inventory gate in step 1)

Run this block ONLY on the instantiation iteration (STATE.md `iteration: 0` / no
`loop/runs/init-*` slice). Every later iteration skips it and goes straight to
the cell cycle (protocol steps 2→10). All Python is **`python3`** (this machine
has no `python` on PATH). Follow the artifact convention verbatim: stdout redirected to one `.txt`
per mode, with `--log-dir` traces in a sibling `logs/` subdir the report glob
ignores — `report.py` raises an uncaught `FileNotFoundError` on any dir lacking
`results.json`, so never point it at a results parent with a bare `*`; glob
`*.txt`.

1. **Clean baseline.** `git status` — the only expected modification is
   `tests/cli_contracts.rs` (pre-existing rustfmt whitespace; harmless). Confirm
   `cargo test` is GREEN now, so a later RED is attributable to your own edit.
2. **omlx up** (else `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL`; do not start it yourself):
   `curl -s -m4 -H "Authorization: Bearer 215069" http://127.0.0.1:10240/v1/models`
3. **Build md:** `cargo build --release` (binary `target/release/md`).
4. **Smoke the local runner reaches omlx** before the full sweep (pi resolves its
   endpoint from pi's own config, NOT the curl'd URL):
   `python3 bench/harness.py --run --runner pi-json --model Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-8bit --mode hybrid --task T1 -N 1 --json --log-dir loop/runs/smoke/logs/ > loop/runs/smoke/probe.txt`
   — confirm the record's `model` is the Qwen id. If pi does NOT route to omlx,
   fall back to `--runner oai-loop --oai-api-base http://127.0.0.1:10240/v1
   --oai-api-key 215069 --model Qwen3.5-27B-4bit` (verified-working; oai-loop
   drops `tool_mix`, so run adoption diagnosis on a pi-json run).
5. **Instantiate the inventory** — full suite, **3 gate modes × tier runner**,
   N≥3 (NOT `mdtools` mode — diagnosis-only, the gate never reads it; on the paid
   frontier tier it burns budget for nothing). LOCAL first (cheap; tool_calls):
   `for MODE in unix hybrid hybrid-no-md; do python3 bench/harness.py --run --runner pi-json --model Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-8bit --mode $MODE --md-binary target/release/md -N 3 --json --log-dir loop/runs/init-local/logs/ > loop/runs/init-local/$MODE.txt; done`
   FRONTIER (claude-cli) — **governed by the Budget policy's Bootstrap
   clause**: this `init-frontier` sweep (~33M tok) is the FIRST frontier spend
   and CREATES the frontier cells. With `frontier_token_cap: 0` it is DEFERRED —
   write `AC-frontier-*` + `AC-MASTER` as placeholder `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL(no-budget)`
   / DEFERRED and do NOT run the command. Run it only if the cap funds ~33M tok:
   `for MODE in unix hybrid hybrid-no-md; do python3 bench/harness.py --run --runner claude-cli --mode $MODE --md-binary target/release/md -N 3 --json --log-dir loop/runs/init-frontier/logs/ > loop/runs/init-frontier/$MODE.txt; done`
6. **Render + sanity-check:**
   `python3 bench/report.py loop/runs/init-local/*.txt loop/runs/init-frontier/*.txt`
   Confirm the claude rows land under a `frontier` tier (not `unspecified`); if
   not, the model stamp failed — pass an explicit `--model claude-...` on the
   claude-cli loop so the tier is deterministic, and re-render.
7. **Attack the seed cell** `AC-frontier-Targeted-mutation` per the gated-delta
   note in the overlay above. Heavy-spend guard — probe one task first:
   `python3 bench/harness.py --run --runner claude-cli --mode hybrid --md-binary target/release/md --task T7 -N 3 --json --log-dir loop/runs/diag/logs/ > loop/runs/diag/T7_hybrid.txt`

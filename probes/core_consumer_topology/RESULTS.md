# Core Consumer Topology Results

## Verdict

**foundation_validated**

- `cli_preservation`: **pass**
- `braid_adoption`: **pass**
- `reader_readiness`: **pass**

## Product Disposition

- The sampled CLI process contract is unchanged from `07eb509`:
  schema, outline, section, tasks, task, and `set-task` matched on exit code,
  stdout, stderr, JSON, and mutation bytes; the complete current Rust suite
  passed.
- A clean Braid-shaped consumer built from the published Cargo package without a
  sibling checkout and immediately translated Markdown task status and source
  coordinates into consumer-owned types.
- A reader-shaped consumer built with default features disabled, had no Clap or
  Walkdir dependency, used outline/section/task queries in-process, and produced
  a guarded task-edit candidate without changing its source or filesystem.
- The reusable single-document surface is complete for the current CLI:
  reads, guarded edit candidates, and relocation all run without process I/O.
  Rendering, viewer state, agent policy, and Braid workflow semantics remain
  outside mdtools.

## Reopening Gate

Reopen this topology result if the CLI protocol version changes, the Cargo
package layout changes, a consumer needs a separate release cadence, or a
future operation cannot preserve direct-core/CLI candidate parity.
